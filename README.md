**OVERVIEW**

In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

**Files**
1. README.md
2. data/vehicles.csv - contains used car data
3. images/ - contains a few images for the problem statement
4. used_car_sales_modeling.ipynb - Jupyter notebook for used car sales modeling 
5. prac2app_utils.py - util functions for plotting, modeling, etc

To frame the task, throughout our practical applications, we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM.  This process provides a framework for working through a data problem.  Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM [here](https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI/module_11/readings_starter.zip).  After reading the overview, answer the questions below.
